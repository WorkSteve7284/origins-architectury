I just made this to change water protection because I want to.
# Origins (Forge)

This is the repository for the source of the unofficial forge port of the Origins mod.

## Resources
Datapacks: Origins forge is supposed to be fully compatible with fabric datapacks, if you want more information, please
visit [the official wiki](https://origins.readthedocs.io/) written for fabric.

## Building from source

The code to build the repository has moved to [here](https://github.com/EdwinMindcraft/origins-forge).

### Disclaimer:
The project doesn't allow for the creation of a unified build yet, which is why there isn't a release
with the new bugfixes.
